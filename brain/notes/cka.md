## Kubernetes architecture
- control plane
  - the control plane is a collection of components that manage the cluster
  - usually run on a dedicated machine
  - kube-api-server serves the Kubernetes API
  - etcd is the backend data store for the cluster
  - kube-scheduler handles scheduling, assigning containers to nodes
  - kube-controller-manager manages the utilities in a single process
  - cloud-controller-manager provides an interface between K8s and cloud platforms
- nodes
  - kubelet is an agent that runs on each node, also reports container status and info
  - container runtime, not built into k8s, but multiple kinds are supported for use (like docker, containerd)
  - kube proxy is a network proxy, runs on each node and does networking
  - to see which node each pod is running on: kubectl get pods -o wide

## Commands
- use -n to return results from a single namespace: kubectl get pods -n example-namespace
- use --all-namespaces to return results from all namespaces: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

## Kubernetes Management
- high availability, multiple instances of control plane
  - control plane and worker nodes often use a lb
  - stacked etcd design pattern: control plane nodes run etcd
  - external etcd design pattern: dedicated nodes for etcd 
- management tools
  - kubectl, official cli
  - kubeadm
  - minikube
  - helm, templating (charts) and package mgmt
  - kompose, for transitioning docker compose to kube objs
  - kustomize, configuration management, templated configs for apps
- safely draining a k8s node: kubectl drain <node name>
  - use the --ignore-daemonsets flag if they are in use on the node
  - after maintenence on the node is complete, use uncordon to tell k8s it is ready: kubectl uncordon <node name>
- upgrading kubernetes with kubeadm (one node at a time to keep from downtime when HA is configured)
  - upgrade the control plane nodes
    - drain the node: kubectl drain <node name> --ignore-daemonsets
    - upgrade kubeadm: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubeadm=1.22.2-00
    - upgrade internal components using the new kubeadm version
      - use plan to see changes: sudo kubeadm upgrade plan v1.22.2
      - use apply to upgrade: sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.22.2
    - upgrade kubelet & kubectl: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubelet=1.22.2-00 kubectl=1.22.2-00
      - sudo systemctl daemon-reload
      - sudo systemctl restart kubelet
    - upgrade the kubelet configuration: kubeadm upgrade node
    - uncordon the node
  - upgrade the worker nodes
    - from the control plane node, drain the worker node: kubectl draing <node name> --ignore-daemonsets # --force may be necessary
    - from the worker node, do upgrade steps
    - upgrade kubeadm: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubeadm=1.22.2-00
    - sudo kubeadm upgrade node
    - upgrade kubelet & kubectl: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubelet=1.22.2-00 kubectl=1.22.2-00
      - sudo systemctl daemon-reload
      - sudo systemctl restart kubelet
    - from the control plane node, uncordon the node: kubectl uncordon <node name>
