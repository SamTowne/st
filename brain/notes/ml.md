## Machine Learning Engineering

### Objective
Gain understanding of machine learning foundations so that I can help organizations who are looking to leverage machine learning advancements. These are examples of some of the tangible skills I would like to have as part of this learning.
  - understand the foundational components an org needs to leverage ML
  - be able to cut through the hype towards solving real problems in the simplest way
  - how to protect an organization from out of control ML spend
  - maturing company intake funnel so that ML is only used when it is the simplest solution for the given problem
  - provide cost/benefit analysis for a ML project so that an organization can determine if it is worth the risk to start training
  - given an existing org, evaluate the gaps that need to be filled before efficient ML work can be started -> data management, governance, tooling, security posture,talent, infrastructure, network, and if necessary, be able to engage a team towards building all this with good stewardship of organizational resources
  - how to automate an ML-powered app including new data ingestion, ETL, inference, training, tuning, and canary deployment
  - given a dataset and an existing ML infrastructure capability, provide training cost estimates
  - understanding how to build an articial intelligence stack with a tiered structure of foundational models, common layer, and app layer as part of a wholistic org-wide design
