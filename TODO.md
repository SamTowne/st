- [X] Choose a router, move to bridge mode with pi running pihole for dns and pivpn
    - Asus router running well
    - Pihole is running great
    - Ran the ISP-router and Asus in parallel for about a month
    - Switched provider WAP to bridge mode so it is serving as a modem only
    - Everything is working well, except certain streaming providers complain about VPN use, so the VPN is off for certain clients, mainly the smart TVs
    - 18.8% of all queries blocked
    - Was going to replace provider modem with our own, but they continued giving us a good rate so there is no need to do that
