- [ ] code review [agentcore examples](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-samples)
- [ ] formae quickstart and init docs
- [ ] build something simple and containerized that uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) for LLM consumption
- [X] vend aws sandbox
- [X] read user guide for bedrock and bedrock agentcore
- [X] copilot vscode quota reached, let's use the continue extension + ollama then continue with MCP, went with their recommended model llama3.1:8b first, auto complete worked fine but sending any requests for evaluation basically broke this macbook pro w only 8gb ram, it's too hungry. trying with qwen3:0.6b next, it's do-able
- [X] get workspace makefile and script for fast workspace creation
- [X] get custodian running on a schedule in aws account, to perform auto-deprovisionining based upon business directives and policies
- [X] debug the sam-eval lambda, and try to make use of the SAM local dev features
- [X] continue the SAM tut https://catalog.workshops.aws/complete-aws-sam/en-US/module-3-manual-deploy/05-module-goals
- [X] Choose a router, move to bridge mode with pi running pihole for dns and pivpn
    - Asus router running well
    - Pihole is running great
    - Ran the ISP-router and Asus in parallel for about a month
    - Switched provider WAP to bridge mode so it is serving as a modem only
    - Everything is working well, except certain streaming providers complain about VPN use, so the VPN is off for certain clients, mainly the smart TVs
    - 18.8% of all queries blocked
    - Was going to replace provider modem with our own, but they continued giving us a good rate so there is no need to do that
- [X] Clean up AWS account, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/automate-deletion-of-aws-resources-by-using-aws-nuke.html
- [X] Set up AWS SAM for local Lambda development
    - Install AWS SAM CLI
    - Create a new SAM application
    - Write a Lambda function to evaluate JSON data using pandas and pyathena
    - Test and debug the function locally
    - Deploy the function to AWS
