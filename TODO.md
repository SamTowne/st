  - asus router running well
  - pihole is running great
  - ran the ISP-router and Asus in parallel for about a month
  - switched provider WAP to bridge mode so it is serving as a modem only
  - everything is working well, except certain streaming providers complain about vpn use, so the vpn is off for certain clients, mainly the smart tvs
  - 18.8% of all queries blocked
  - was going to replace provider modem with our own, but they continued giving us a good rate so there is no need to do that
