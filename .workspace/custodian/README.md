## Development Setup

This project uses Python 3.12. To ensure that you're using the correct version of Python and to isolate your environment, we recommend using `pyenv` and `virtualenv`.

### Installing pyenv and virtualenv

If you haven't installed `pyenv` and `virtualenv` yet, you can do so by following the instructions on their respective GitHub pages:

- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

### Setting up the Python version

Once you have `pyenv` installed, you can install the required Python version and set it for the current directory:

```bash
pyenv install 3.12.3
pyenv local 3.12.3
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
